OpenAssistantGPT utilizes the OpenAI Assistant API to construct its chatbot. Therefore, it is essential to familiarize yourself with their [main documentation](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) before getting started.

When employing the assistant, we make use of the retrieval function, meaning we only support gpt-3.5-turbo-1106 and gpt-4-1106-preview models. For a deeper understanding of this retrieval function, we highly recommend reading the documentation on [Knowledge Retrieval](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/tools/knowledge-retrieval)

For additional information on tiers, you can find more details [here](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/rate-limits/usage-tiers?context=tier-one) about tiers.
